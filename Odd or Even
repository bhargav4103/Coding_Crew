Given a positive integer N, determine whether it is odd or even.
solution : 
=> % is used to find the reminder when numerator is divided by denominator.
=> A number gives a remainder of 1 if it is divided by 2 when it is odd and 0 when it is even
=> N%2==0 then even else odd.
class Solution{   
public:
    string oddEven(int N){
        // code here 
        if(N%2!=0) return "odd";
        else return "even";
    }
};
