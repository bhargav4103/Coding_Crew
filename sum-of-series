Write a program to find the sum of the given series 1+2+3+ . . . . . .(N terms)
solution : 
class Solution {
  public:
    long long seriesSum(int n) {
        // code here
        //There is a mathematical formula for calculating the sum of n numbers
        // since the input data is of type int its evaluation also rounds off to int 
        // so to overcome that we typecasted to long long before evaluating
        return (((long long)n)*(n+1))/2;
    }
};
