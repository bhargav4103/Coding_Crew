Given the first 2 terms a1 and a2 of an Arithmetic Series.Find the nth term of the series

solution : 
=> From mathematical equations we can find the common difference by substracting two consecutive terms of AP
=> After getting Common Difference we can find the nth term by the formula first_term+(n-1)*cd
class Solution {
  public:
    int nthTermOfAP(int a1, int a2, int n) {
        // code here
      //common difference
        int d=a2-a1;
        return (a1+(n-1)*d);
    }
};
