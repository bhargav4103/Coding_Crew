For a given 3 digit number, find whether it is armstrong number or not. 
An Armstrong number of three digits is a number such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. 
Return "Yes" if it is a armstrong number else return "No".
NOTE: 371 is an Armstrong number since 33 + 73 + 13 = 371
solution : 
=> first we need to find each digits and add digit^3 to the sum
=> at last check if that sum is equal to the original number
class Solution {
  public:
    string armstrongNumber(int n){
        // code here
        int orig=n;
        int sum=0;
      // code for finding each digits and then cubing the digit and adding to sum
        while(n>0)
        {
            int d=n%10;
            sum=sum+d*d*d;
            n=n/10;
        }
      // checking if that is equal to original number
        if(orig==sum) return "Yes";
        else return "No";
    }
};
