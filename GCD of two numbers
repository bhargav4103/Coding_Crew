Given two positive integers a and b, find GCD of a and b.

Note: Don't use the inbuilt gcd function

solution : 
=>If B is 0, it means A is the greatest common divisor. So, return A.
=>If B is not 0, call the gcd function recursively with B as the new A and A % B as the new B.
=>This step effectively replaces A with B and B with the remainder when dividing A by B.
=>The recursive calls continue until B becomes 0, at which point the function returns A, which is the greatest common divisor.
class Solution {
  public:
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        // code here
       if(a==0) return b;
       return(gcd(b%a,a));
    }
};
